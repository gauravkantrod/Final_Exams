Because of the high demand for tickets you only get to stay for one hour but you get to pick your choice of party place since you received a special ticket. You have access to a schedule that lists when exactly each loction is going to host the party. You want to get as many pictures with celebrities as possible to improve your social standing. This means you wish to go for the hour when you get to hob-nob with the maximum number of loction and get selfies with each of party location. We are given a list of intervals that correspond to when each celebrity and locations comes and goes. Assume that these intervals are **(i,j)**, where  i and j correspond to hours. That is, the interval is closed on the left hand side and open on the right hand side. This just means that the celebrity will be partying on and through the hour, but enter at \"ith hour\" and goes at \"jth hour\".
